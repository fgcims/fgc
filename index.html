    <h1>Make It Work, Make It Right, Make It Fast, Make It Easy, Make It Simple</h1>
    <h2>Code for the End User and the Next Programmer, Not for the Computer</h2>

    <h3>Welcome to MakeIT, an associate website of a non-profit for Free Learning on Real Life Development of Dynamic Web Applications Using Open-Source Software.  On the current project, we are using LAMP with PHP, HTML, CSS, Javascript, AJAX.  Next projects will be using Python, Java, Git and frameworks.</h3> 
    <h4>The web applications streamline the procedures in refurbishing computers and associated items, which go through the process of intake, triage, build, quality check, inventory management, sales, scrapping/recycling, and financial accounting.  This is supported by a time management system which keeps track of volunteer orientation, training, activities done and certificates, contributed hours, and earned/redeemed reward points.  Future modules will include among others, monitoring of free classes on introduction to computers, programming languages, etc.  <p>The free learning meetups are held every 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Saturdays of the month between 1:00 and 4:00 PM.  This is currently suspended due to the pandemic or please call (999) 999-9999 for any change on the schedule.</h4>

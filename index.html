    <h3>Welcome to FGCIMS, a non-profit for Free Learning on Real Life Development of Dynamic Web Applications Using LAMP, with PHP and open-source software.</h3> 
    <h4>The web applications streamline the procedures in refurbishing computers and associated items, which go through the process of intake, triage, build, quality check, inventory management, sales, scrapping/recycling, and financial accounting.  This is supported by a time management system which keeps track of volunteer orientation, training, activities done and certificates, contributed hours, and earned/redeemed reward points.  Future modules will include among others, monitoring of free classes on introduction to computers, programming languages, etc.  The free learning meetups are held every 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Saturdays of the month between 1:00 and 4:00 PM.  This is currently suspended due to the pandemic or please call (999) 999-9999 for any change on the scheudle.</h4>
